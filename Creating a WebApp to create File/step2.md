<!--Create the file to be displayed-->

Let's start by creating a file we will call "learner.txt":

Add the code below to create the file:

```
echo "Welcome to Brainarator's server!" > learner.txt
```

In the next steps, when we view the `/view/learner`, our web app should show `Welcome to Brainarator's server!` on the web page.
We will see how.
